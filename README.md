# abbreviation-list-english
An extensive abbreviations list in English for NLP studies.

This list is compiled from several internet resources. It includes most common abbreviations in text, SMS, and social media messaging such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as well as some online gaming abbreviations. I compiled them for my twitter NLP projects. 

I also added a code snippet in Python to change the abbreviated words with the original words.
